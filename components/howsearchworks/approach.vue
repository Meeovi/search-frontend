                                Every day, fifteen percent of searches are ones we haven't seen before, so we use
                                automated systems to get you the most relevant and reliable information we can find. To
                                help you find what you're looking for, these systems consider many factors, including
                                the words in your query, the content of pages, the expertise of sources, and your
                                language and location. To measure whether people continue to find our results relevant
                                and reliable, we have a rigorous process that involves extensive testing and the use of
                                quality raters who ensure our automated systems produce great results as a human would
                                expect.

                                information and make it universally accessible and useful. That's why Search makes it
                                easy to discover a broad range of information from a wide variety of sources. Some
                                information is simple, like the height of the Eiffel Tower. For more complex topics,
                                Search is a tool to explore many angles so you can form your own understanding of the
                                world.

                                places or sights you searched for before you've even finished typing them. When you use
